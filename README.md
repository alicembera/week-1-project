# EDA on Indian startup funding from 2018 up to 2021
## Exploratory Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

In this project, I am trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. And the main was To analyze funding trends and dynamics within the Indian start-up ecosystem from 2018 up to 2021 and propose strategic recommendations for the team's venture.

## Conclusion 
Based on the analysis of funding trends from 2018 to 2021, it's evident that the Technology sector has been a standout performer, attracting significant investments.

This sector, along with related tech-incorporated sectors like retail and health, presents promising opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs. 

Bangalore and Mumbai, being a prominent hub for startups and investments, offers valuable networking prospects. 

Therefore, exploring opportunities in tech-driven sectors and engaging with Mumbai's startup ecosystem could lead to favorable outcomes in terms of growth and innovation.
